Otherwise we could just crudely approximate it by finding the most abundant molecules and assume they would dominate the absorption. For example, 62% of cerebrospinal fluid is composed of albumin, and all membranes are composed of lipid bilayers that all have very similar molar absorption coefficients. Most of this information and more can be found in <a href=\"http://bookzz.org/book/1128035/c6f178\">this book</a>. Or we could neglect this all together.

Each fluophor has a particular quantum efficiency, $q$, which is the number of photons emitted divided by the number of photons absorbed. So we represent the amount of energy emitted as the product of the incident radiant energy and the quantum efficiency, $q\\Phi_i$. However, the indicators also have a propensity to absorb some of the photons that were emitted by its neighbors and that must be accounted for as well, $q\\Phi_ie^{-\\mu_{a.ind}bc}$.

I could not find a reference yet, but it is my understanding that this is assumed to be more or less equilibrated after some time and to be something that is independent of distance from the injection sight. This is because the indicator is delivered via a virus and once the cell has been infected it begins producing the proteins internally. While cells produce these proteins at different rates from the little bit I could find this variability should be small enough that a decently approximating constant value should exist. Or again, we can ignore this. I just want to make sure I know what I'm ignoring."

I chose to ignore the quantum fluctions during sampling as that was beginning to go over my head. After reading over the microscope manual I believe everything else can be modeled. Starting with the PMT, it is essentially just adding noise so we model it by some function that returns the signal with added noise, $N(F)$. Then, as far as I'm aware, all that is left is to add the offset, $s\\approx -1pA$ and multiplying by the gain g, which I couldn't find by examining the microscope.
