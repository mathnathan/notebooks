    "As we see, the plots are what we would have expected them to be =). This is great news. The second plot down shows the flow from frame 192->193 which in slide 44 of the presentation shows the inward flow of calcium to the point, and the next frame is when the diffusive event takes place. This is clearly shown in the next plot which shows the flow from frame 193->194. The zero crossing in the plot is easy to detect and it predicts the hotspot to be located at the spatial coordinates (x=169.019034,y=128.333777). This is where we would have expected it to occur by visually inspecting the flow in slide 44 of the presentation. What remains is to add a statistical confidence of how likely the hotspot is to be significant. This will be based on how frequently it apprea"
