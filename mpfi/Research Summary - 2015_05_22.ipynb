      "We are attempting to find information about the flow of calcium. We will outline the method being used (for now) below. Following the outline I will examine it with simple test cases. I will use a simple 3D gaussian function to represent calcium concentrations. By shifting the guassian around to different locations we can simulate the notion of calcium movement within successive frames. We will take this foundation and construct different scenarios to explore the limits of the method. For example we will look at both wave like and diffusion like processes\n",

      "We will approximate the flow within 5 frames: $F_1,F_2,F_3,F_4,F_5$. The steps are enumerated below.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Spatial Denoising\n",
      "- Transform all 5 frames into the frequency domain via the Discrete Cosine Transform$^*$ $$\\hat{F}_i = \\text{DCT}(F_i)$$ \n",
      "- Remove some of the higher modes with lower power to mitigate the influence of noise in the original signal. Practically, this translates to setting them equal to zero. $$\\hat{F}_i[m_x: \\hspace{3pt},m_y:] = 0$$ where the $m_x$ and $m_y$ are the locations where we truncate the modes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Temporal Denoising\n",
      "- Still within the frequency domain we take a temporal average of the first 3 frames $\\tilde{F}_2 = \\frac{\\hat{F}_1+\\hat{F}_2+\\hat{F}_3}{3}$ and the last three frames $\\tilde{F}_4 = \\frac{\\hat{F}_3+\\hat{F}_4+\\hat{F}_5}{3}$. This averaging also \"slows\" down fast processes. This should help in the test cases where we examine fast diffusion and waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Temporal Derivative\n",
      "- Then we take the difference between these spatially denoised and temporally avergaed frames to approximate the temporal derivative. $$\\frac{\\partial \\hat{F}_3}{\\partial t} \\approx \\tilde{F}_4 - \\tilde{F}_2$$\n",
      "\n",
      "### Fit a Surface\n",
      "- Then we transform back into cartesian space with the inverse DCT $$\\frac{\\partial F_3}{\\partial t} \\approx \\text{DCT}^{-1}(\\frac{\\partial \\hat{F}_3}{\\partial t})$$\n",
      "- We down-sample the image for computational efficiency\n",
      "- Then fit it with a two dimensional cubic interpolant. We now have a smoothed, continuous ($C^3$ to be precise) representation of the temporal derivative.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Determine Flow\n",
      "- We then calculate the gradient of the temporal derivative which gives us our first approximation to the flow. This vector field is the union of the \"correct\" flow along with artifacts of the method. $$ \\nabla \\frac{\\partial F_3}{\\partial t}(x,y) \\approx \\bigg< \\frac{\\partial F_3}{\\partial x \\partial t}(x,y), \\frac{\\partial F_3}{\\partial y \\partial t}(x,y) \\bigg>$$\n",
      "- To remove the artifacts we only keep the vectors whose magnitudes constitute the top 15% (this may need to be localized and not global)\n",
      "- Then only keep those vectors whose tails and heads have opposite signs on the approximate temporal derivative. For example, the vectors at location $x,y$ that we keep satisfy the following criteria. $$\\nabla \\frac{\\partial F_3}{\\partial t}\\bigg (\\frac{\\partial F_3}{\\partial x \\partial t}(x,y), \\frac{\\partial F_3}{\\partial y \\partial t}(x,y) \\bigg) * \\nabla \\frac{\\partial F_3}{\\partial t}(x,y) < 0 $$"
